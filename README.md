Maintain a database recordinginformation about purebred, registered Holstien cattle.
The database records facts about the performance of individual animals and their ancestors.

Each registered Holstien, living or dead, has a unique ten digit registration number that
identifies it. Each sire, the registered father that sired it, and a dam, the registered
animal that was its mother. Each has a name, date of birth, and gender.
